# PyTradier (Work in Progress)

PyTradier is a library for interacting with the Tradier.com API for market data, company information, and trading actions through their brokerage. Since it is still early in development, the documentation for this python package will be updated as the project builds. 

Documentation for this library is hosted by RTD: https://pytradier.readthedocs.io/
